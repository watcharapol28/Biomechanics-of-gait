<h2>Scope</h2>
<h3>First thought</h3>
- Check some disease with abnormal gait</br>
- Check some symptoms from abnormal gait</br>
- Check risk for some symptoms from abnormal gait</br>
<h3>Done</h3>
- Risk for neck pain.</br>
- Risk for limping gait.</br>
- Risk for Hip hike.</br>
- Risk for Parkinson.</br>
<h3>Problem</h3>
- Must be viewed from the side only.</br>
- Did not use AI for training or prediction.</br>
- Quite a bit of relevant information or research.</br>
- Datasets related to various diseases are quite rare.</br>
<h3>Continue in the future</h3>
- Use AI for train model or predict disease.</br>
- Applied with accessories for greater accuracy.</br>
