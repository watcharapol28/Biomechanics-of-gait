# Biomechanics-of-gait
Topic : Biomechanics of gait with image processing for classification of normal and abnormal gait.
Knowledge : Image processing, Math equations, Computer vision, Machine learning, Disease or symptom with abnormal gait.
Tools : Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, Numpy.

<h2>Scope</h2>
<h3>First thought</h3>
  - Check some disease with abnormal gait
  - Check some symptoms from abnormal gait
  - Check risk for some symptoms from abnormal gait
<h3>Done</h3>
  - Risk for neck pain.
  - Risk for limping gait.
  - Risk for Hip hike.
  - Risk for Parkinson.
<h3>Problem</h3>
  - Must be viewed from the side only.
  - Did not use AI for training or prediction.
  - Quite a bit of relevant information or research.
  - Datasets related to various diseases are quite rare.
<h3>Continue in the future</h3>
  - Use AI for train model or predict disease.
  - Applied with accessories for greater accuracy.
