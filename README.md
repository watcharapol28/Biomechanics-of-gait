Scope
- First thought
  Check some disease with abnormal gait
  Check some symptoms from abnormal gait
  Check risk for some symptoms from abnormal gait
- Done
  Risk for neck pain.
  Risk for limping gait.
  Risk for Hip hike.
  Risk for Parkinson.
- Problem
  Must be viewed from the side only.
  Did not use AI for training or prediction.
  Quite a bit of relevant information or research.
  Datasets related to various diseases are quite rare.
- Continue in the future
  Use AI for train model or predict disease.
  Applied with accessories for greater accuracy.
