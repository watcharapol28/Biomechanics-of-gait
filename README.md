</br>

``` <a> Upgrade pip </a>
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
</br>

install tools:
</br>

```
python -m pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

install my project:</br>
``` <a>Clone project</a>
  git clone https://github.com/watcharapol28/Biomechanics-of-gait.git
```
</br>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<h3>First thought</h3>
- Check some disease with abnormal gait</br>
- Check some symptoms from abnormal gait</br>
- Check risk for some symptoms from abnormal gait</br>
<h3>Done</h3>
- Risk for neck pain.</br>
- Risk for limping gait.</br>
- Risk for Hip hike.</br>
- Risk for Parkinson.</br>
<h3>Problem</h3>
- Must be viewed from the side only.</br>
- Did not use AI for training or prediction.</br>
- Quite a bit of relevant information or research.</br>
- Datasets related to various diseases are quite rare.</br>
<h3>Continue in the future</h3>
- Use AI for train model or predict disease.</br>
- Applied with accessories for greater accuracy.</br>
